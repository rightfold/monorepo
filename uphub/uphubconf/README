uphubconf is an application with an HTTP API that is used by uphubcli to
configure uphubd.

The boot folder contains index.php, which sets up all the PHP boilerplate and
then calls the application which is defined in src. The vendor directory is
generated by the derivation, and is therefore not part of the source code.
