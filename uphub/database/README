The database is called uphub_test. It contains the uphub schema that contains
all objects. The public schema is deliberately deleted to avoid security
problems with relying on schema search paths.

There are two roles:

    The role uphub_application is used by the application for ordinary
    operations that manipulate the data in the database.

    The role uphub_migrations is used by Sqitch for running migrations. This
    role owns the objects in the database as well as the database itself.

We do not use the Sqitch verify feature.
